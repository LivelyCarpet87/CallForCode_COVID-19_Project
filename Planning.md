# Potential problems to solve

1. Testing

2. Avoidance of high-density areas

3. Predictions

# Potential limitations

1. Small/biased data

2. Limited computing power

#Project Ideas

1. Implementing a more efficient "mass testing" with the help of pre-screening and planning from computers

2. Developing an APP that encorporates the concept of Federated Learning to compile data and tell people whether they have been 
   "in contact" with people infected with the virus without loss of data privacy


# To-Do

- [ ] Find potential problems to solve
